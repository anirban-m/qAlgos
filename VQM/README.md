In this notebook we implement the variational quantum eigensolver for systematically finding the low energy subspace comprised of the ground state and the 1st excited state, for the __disordered three site fermionic model with onsite interaction__, (here $t_{ij}$ are chosen from a __uniform random distribution__).
